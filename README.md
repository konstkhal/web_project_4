#### Git Workflow used
##### Step-by-Step Instructions on Working with Branches Like a Professional
1. Merge all the code from main into develop before starting the new stage of development.
2. Create a feature branch from develop and name it like this: feature/feature-name.
3. Develop the new feature in the feature/feature-name branch.
4. Once it's finished, merge the code from feature/feature-name into develop.
5. Delete the feature/feature-name branch.
6. If you need to develop another feature, return to step 2.
7. Test and debug all the new features in the develop branch, and then merge them into main.
8. Send your project for review.
9. Once you get the reviewer's feedback, create the hotfix branch for fixing any errors found. Name the branch like this: hotfix/bug-name.
10. Once you're done with hotfixes, merge the code from hotfix/bug-name into main.
11. Delete the hotfix/bug-name branch.
12. If the reviewer returns the project with some more comments, return to step 9.
